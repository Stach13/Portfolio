                    <h4>Notes</h4>
                    <p>This script I wrote, was the backbone behind every shot and dialogue piece in my short film "Blissful". It includes around 
                10 pages of written interpretations for each scene in the film. Many words that were highlighted indicated that they were part of the 
                dialogue. Though I wasn't in charge of creating the dialogue, I was tasked with creating the storyboard and listing the video equipment needed for each scene. 
                I also, specified a variety of different post-production techniques that would be added to certain shots. Everything in brackets show the type of 
                camera movement desired and most of each bulleted list describes shots, considering the film wasn't heavy in terms of dialogue, rather the focus was more direceted towards 
                the cinematography aspect.</p>

                    <h4>Notes</h4>
                    <p>This is another script I wrote for a co-directed film called "Fortune Machine". I decided not to include this video in my portfolio
                    only because I didn't put as much time into it as I hoped for and because I wasn't the Producer. However, I did write most of the script in this as well, with me (again) being tasked to 
                    write out the storyboard, giving a detailed list of what will be visually displayed across a screen. I listed some of the same camera movements, types of lighting, 
                    and equipment that would be featured in the scene.</p>
